        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The 'Human-Computer Interaction' science like its name says is regarding the interaction between humans (persons who try to accomplish a specific goal) and computers (machines that run software applications). In other words, it is about the whole process
            of interacting with a machine from the usability, efficiency, and intuitiveness to the feelings that a person is experiencing when using a specific software application. So, in this case, every little detail counts the color palette, the typography,
            the position of graphical elements, every image, every sound everything counts because the users are affected more or less by these design elements. How the user is feeling while and after using an application makes the difference between
            a good and a bad product.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this article I will discuss about the 'Human-Computer Interaction' principles, methods and best practices I used in the designing process of my Bachelor Thesis software application: EduLink. I will do this by going through some of the main topics of
            the 'Human-Computer interaction'. I will provide some information about the each topic and after that I will discuss about how I used it in my application design.

            <h3>The EduLink application purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The scope of the 'EduLink' software product is to increase the efficiency of managing the school courses from both teacher and student perspectives and to increase the online interaction between students and teachers by providing an easy-to-use tool for
                both them so that they can easily communicate, share resources and submit or receive assignments.

        <h2>Human Factors</h2>
        <p>
            The main idea of this topic is that the developer needs to really realize that the application it develops will be used by the humans. When we talk about the humans we talk about diversity. So, the first question which should be raised is: "Who will use
            this app?". There are a lot of characteristic which can differentiate the users as: age, the gender, the education, physical abilities, computer-related-abilities and so on. Also, there are different contexts where apps are used like: entertainment,
            social applications, financial applications and so on. The second question which would be raised is "Where this app will be used". Because there are different idioms, colors, layouts and other stuff which should be specific to the environment
            where the app is used. For example I don't know if an economist will enjoy a colorfull application, but in the same time I don't think that a black and white social application will work very well for its users. So depend on the context a
            specific design will create positive feelings but the same design in another context will not.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the designing process of the EduLink application, I tried to take into consideration the all mentioned factors. I used familiar UI components as a typical login/register form, the very common left side navigation menu, and also I paid attention to
            all used icons to be very expressive because this app will be used also by the kids. Also, I tried to keep the color palette simple because it is not an entertainment app, but at the same time, I used some colors because the app needs to be
            enjoyable to the students.

            <h2>Design Methodologies</h2>
            <p>

                While Software engineering is mainly focused on communication between applications and developers or between teams of developers, Human-Computer Interaction considers communication with the user. When the user is not the first priority in the engineer's
                mind, he can go into the task-centered interface trap of developing mammoth applications with a lot of useless features. To obtain a good product, you should keep in mind tha t this application is developed for users and it must please,
                help, and even protect the user. In the same time, the interaction with an application should be as natural as possible. It should simulate evan a real dialog in same cases. to make sure your application is useful, usable, and desirable
                for users it's a good idea to ask them. But it would be a waste to develop the whole application and just after that to get the user feedback. So, for receiving this feedback it's enough to have some sketches and some mockups.

            <p>
                When it comes down to the EduLink application which I have designed, I was focussed on the user experience trying to obtain a useful and enjoyable product. To get a good user experience I used also some well-known design patterns; we all know that it's
                easier to do a thing when you know how to it, so tried to keep the visual consistency and to use similar interactive buttons across the pages of the application (Habituation). I used the 'Card stack' pattern via some tabs to protect the
                user from an information explosion and to keep the user-focused. I implemented a left-side navigation bar that permits users to navigate between app pages but won't let them feel lost (Safe Exploration'). When it comes to user experience
                each detail matters, so I instantly provide feedback when enters his credentials to login.(Instant Gratification).
